# wolf-actuator [V1.1]
# Description
The WOLF actuator is a high-torque 3D-printable planetary robotic actuator. The design is based on the Wolfrom PGT, and does not require a planet gear carrier or planet gear bearings. All planet gears are equally spaced, and provide a large contact area for both the sun gear and ring gears. All gears are replaceable for added modularity and easy maintenance. [Modular crossed-roller bearings](https://github.com/Anthrobotics/modular-bearing) on both ends of the actuator provide WOLF with improved load-bearing capabilities, and smoother motion. The actuator is fully-backdriveable, and is capable of compliant control and force sensing. WOLF can be manufactured using a number of methods, including FDM and SLS 3D printing, and CNC machining.

# Improvements from V1.0
- [Modular bearings](https://github.com/Anthrobotics/modular-bearing) for easy maintenance
- Separate mounting points - no more risking actuator disassembly when mounting loads
- 67 mm height has been maintained - thin form factor
- reduced unique part count - from 14, down to 12.

# Specifications
The specs of the V1.1 WOLF actuator are as follows:
- (Theoretical) Continuous Torque: 80 Nm
- (Theoretical) Peak Torque: 120 Nm
- Reduction: 34:1
- Weight: 1.2 Kg
- Max Operating Current: 58 A
- Operating Voltage Range: 24 VDC - 52 VDC
- Diameter: 202.3 mm
- Height: 67 mm
- Encoder: AS5047P

# Testing
A number of tests have been performed on V1.0 of WOLF. The test model of WOLF was entirely 3D-printed using Polysonic PLA. Initial torque testing demonstrated that WOLF could output ~40.8 Nm of continuous torque, while consuming 10 A @ 30 VDC. Further testing will be performed to evaluate WOLF's performance at higher current limits, and with SLS-printed nylon gears.

The actuator was capable of rotating the entire leg of our humanoid robot approximately 75 degrees in both forward and reverse directions. The weight of the leg is ~6 Kg, and 110 cm in height.
