# wolf-actuator [V1]
# Description
The WOLF actuator is a high-torque 3D-printable planetary robotic actuator. The design is based on the Wolfrom PGT, and does not require a planet gear carrier or planet gear bearings. All planet gears are equally spaced, and provide a large contact area for both the sun gear and ring gears. All gears are replaceable for added modularity, easy maintenance and reduced material consumption. Two individual crossed-roller bearings on both ends of the actuator provide WOLF with load-bearing capabilities, and smoother motion. The actuator is fully-backdriveable, and is capable of current-based control and force sensing. WOLF can be manufactured using a number of methods, including FDM and SLS 3D printing, and CNC machining.

# Testing
A number of tests have been performed on V1 of WOLF. The test model of WOLF was entirely 3D-printed using Polysonic PLA. Initial torque testing demonstrated that WOLF could output ~40.8 Nm of continuous torque, while consuming 10 A @ 30 VDC. Further testing will be performed to evaluate WOLF's performance at higher current limits, and with SLS-printed nylon gears.

# Assembly Guide
An video assembly guide will be created soon.

# Usage
WOLF can be used in a number of applications, including:
- Humanoid robots
- Large quadruped robots
- 3-Axis motion systems
- Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)

WARNING: DO NOT place fingers or appendages near the gearing of the actuator while it is in motion.
